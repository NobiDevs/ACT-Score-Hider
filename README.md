### Features

- **Confetti Effects**: Trigger confetti animations based on score thresholds
- **Persistence**: Remember which scores you've revealed

### How It Works

1. When you visit an ACT scores page, the extension automatically scans for score elements
2. Valid scores are replaced with "?"
3. Hidden scores have a dashed border and a "?" placeholder
4. Click any hidden score to reveal it with a sound effect and/or confetti if configured
5. Customize sound and confetti thresholds in the popup settings
6. Upload custom MP3 files for personalized sound effects

```Confetti Effects```
- Enable/disable confetti animations
- Set score thresholds for confetti intensity (low, medium, high)
- Automatic confetti on score reveal based on thresholds

```Storage```
